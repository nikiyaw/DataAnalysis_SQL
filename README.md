# Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
The main goal of this project is to study and identity trends and obtain useful information regarding customers spending habits in certain websites. From a business perspective, it is crucial to understand where the customers are, what products are popular, how much are the customers are spending etc. With this information in hand, companies are able to tailor and target certain customer groups more efficiently. 


## Process
1. Start off by scheming through different tables and make sense of the bigger picture.
- each table provides a piece of the puzzle that forms the bigger picture

2. Start with the data cleaning process. 
- assign suitable data types (to analyze data easier)
- remove duplicated/redundant data
- handle missing data (need to make assumptions -> decreases credibility)

3. Start asking questions and identify trends from the semi-clean data. (Keep bigger picture in mind and ask the right questions to extract important and useful information)
- look at different variables and see if there is a relationship between them (time of year vs. spending value)

4. Note down future improvements that can be implemented to better the accuracy of our data. 
- suggestion on how to proceed in future projects 


## Results (picked 3)
1. The data shows that the United States brings in the largest amount of revenue compare to other countries.
2. Organic Search is the most popular way for customers to assess the website and it also brings in the highest revenue. 
3. The sales has been similar constant throughout the year, ranging between 30,000+ dollars to 45,000+ dollars per month.  


## Challenges 
1. Lack of data in multiple columns. 
2. Inconsistent data types in some columns.
3. Redundant columns that doesn't provide any information. 


## Future Goals
1. Organize all_sessions table into multiple tables. 
2. Rename the tables and columns into something more intuitive and easy to understand. 
3. Remove overlapping information between tables.
